# Item-Based-Recomendation System and AB Testing

The Movie Recommendation system is a tool that helps users to group together people who have common interests. 
A recommender system's primary aim is to locate content that may be of interest to an individual. Furthermore, it takes into account a variety of variables in order to build 
tailored lists of useful and interesting material for each user.

In this tutorial, I make an item-based Movie Recommendation model via python, and also to reach whether there is any users' interest difference between the last 10-year term and the last 20-year term, 
I employ AB Testing.
